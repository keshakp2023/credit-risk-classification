**An overview of the analysis**
In this study, we want to create a computerize model that can predict how probable it is for individuals to repay loans on websites where they borrow from other people. We will also check how well this model works.

**The results:**
Balanced Accuracy Score: 94% --> This shows that the model's overall accuracy and considering ability to find both positives and negatives rate was 94%.
Recall Score: 94% --> This means the model accurately found 94% of the actual positive cases out of all the positive cases.
Precision Score: 92% --> This indicates that the model was accurate in its positive predictions 92% of the time.

**A summary:**
I suggest using this model to predict if borrowers are likely to repay their loans. It is accurate, with over 94% success in predicting loan repayment. This accuracy can help create a business plan to mitigage any future risk and make sure that lenders have sufficient money to remain strong and profitable."
